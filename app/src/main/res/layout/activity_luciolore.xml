            android:text="In Rio de Janeiro, there were those who were wondering exactly the same thing. One of those people was Lúcio Correia dos Santos, a young man who grew up in a poor and crowded area that was hit particularly hard by the financial troubles that rocked the world after the Omnic Crisis. Lúcio didn’t have a solution for the troubles that plagued his home, but he had a gift for music — and he decided to use that gift to at least lift the spirits of those around him and bring the community together, let them forget their troubles for even a little while.

But those idyllic moments spent performing on street corners, block parties and underground shows weren’t going to last. The Vishkar Corporation moved its efforts worldwide, and secured a contract to redevelop parts of Rio de Janeiro, promising that the development would improve the lives of everyone in the city. Yet instead of improvement, Vishkar went about the usual process of order and control — by instating curfews, coming down hard on anything the company perceived as “lawless behavior,” and exploiting the general populace as a labor force.

Lúcio wasn’t about to let the Vishkar Corporation have its way, and decided to indulge in a little “lawless behavior” of his own by stealing some of Vishkar’s sonic technology, technology that had been used to suppress his people. He took that technology and fashioned it instead into a tool to rally people into action — and rally they did, in an uprising that drove Vishkar right out of the neighborhood. No longer an underground performer, Lúcio rocketed to stardom almost overnight, a symbol for unity and positive social change."></TextView>
